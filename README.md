   ```

### 2. Loading the Project

1. **Open ObjectStudio IDE**
   - Launch ObjectStudio development environment
   - Open the System Browser

2. **Load XML Files**
   Load the following XML files in order:
   ```
   1. Employee.xml                    (Model layer)
   2. EmployeeDatabase.xml           (Database layer)
   3. CreateEmployeeValidator.xml    (Validation)
   4. ReadEmployeeValidator.xml      (Validation)
   5. UpdateEmployeeValidator.xml    (Validation)
   6. DeleteEmployeeValidator.xml    (Validation)
   7. EmployeeService.xml            (Service layer)
   8. EmployeeListView.xml           (GUI Components)
   9. EmployeeFormView.xml           (GUI Components)
   10. EmployeeSearchView.xml        (GUI Components)
   11. EmployeeManagementWindow.xml  (Main GUI)
   12. EmployeeManagementController.xml (Controller)
   13. EmployeeManagementApp.xml     (Application)
   14. EmployeeManagementDeployment.xml (Deployment)
   ```

3. **Compile All Classes**
   - In the System Browser, select "Compile All" to compile all loaded classes
   - Resolve any compilation errors if they occur

### 3. Database Setup

The application automatically creates the SQLite database (`employees.db`) on first run with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    department TEXT NOT NULL,
    salary REAL NOT NULL,
    hire_date TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

No manual database setup is required.

### Architecture Overview

- **Model Layer**: `Employee.xml` - Core employee data model
- **Database Layer**: `EmployeeDatabase.xml` - SQLite database operations
- **Service Layer**: `EmployeeService.xml` - Business logic and validation coordination
- **Validation Layer**: `*Validator.xml` files - Input validation and business rules
- **View Layer**: `*View.xml` files - GUI components and user interface
- **Controller Layer**: `EmployeeManagementController.xml` - Application flow control
- **Application Layer**: `EmployeeManagementApp.xml` - Application entry point

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**
   ```smalltalk
   EmployeeManagementApp main
   ```
   Or alternatively:
   ```smalltalk
   EmployeeManagementApp start
   ```

2. **Using the GUI**
   - The main window will open with employee list view
   - Use "Add Employee" button to create new employees
   - Double-click on employee records to edit
   - Use search functionality to find specific employees
   - Select employees and use "Delete" to remove records

### Basic Operations

**Create Employee:**
```smalltalk
employee := Employee new
    name: 'John Doe';
    email: 'john.doe@company.com';
    department: 'Engineering';
    salary: 75000;
    hireDate: Date today;
    yourself.
EmployeeService instance createEmployee: employee.
```

**Read Employee:**
```smalltalk
employee := EmployeeService instance readEmployee: 1.
```

**Update Employee:**
```smalltalk
employee salary: 80000.
EmployeeService instance updateEmployee: employee.
```

**Delete Employee:**
```smalltalk
EmployeeService instance deleteEmployeeById: 1.
```

## üî® Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Modify Classes**: Edit the XML files or use the System Browser
2. **Recompile**: Compile modified classes
3. **Test**: Run the application to test changes
4. **Debug**: Use ObjectStudio debugger for troubleshooting

### Adding New Features

1. Follow the existing architecture patterns
2. Add appropriate validation in validator classes
3. Update service layer for new business logic
4. Modify GUI components as needed
5. Update deployment configuration if required

### Testing

- Manual testing through the GUI application
- Unit testing can be added using ObjectStudio's testing framework
- Database operations can be tested independently

## üöÄ Deployment

### Creating Windows Executable

1. **Open Deployment Manager** in ObjectStudio IDE

2. **Create Deployment Configuration:**
   - Application Name: `EmployeeManagementSystem`
   - Main Class: `EmployeeManagementApp`
   - Startup Method: `main`
   - Target: Windows Executable

3. **Configure Settings:**
   - Executable Name: `EmployeeManagement.exe`
   - Include Runtime: Yes
   - Compress Executable: Yes
   - Target Platform: Windows

4. **Build Process:**
   - Add all required classes from the project
   - Include necessary ObjectStudio packages
   - Build the executable

The resulting `EmployeeManagement.exe` will be a standalone Windows application including the ObjectStudio runtime and all dependencies.

### Deployment Script

Use the deployment script generator:
```smalltalk
EmployeeManagementDeployment createDeploymentScript
```

This generates a complete deployment script for automated builds.
