# Employee Management System - VisualWorks 8.8

A comprehensive Employee Management System converted from ANSI Smalltalk to VisualWorks 8.8 format, featuring Windows-native GUI, CRUD operations, data validation, and persistent storage.

## Features

- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete employees
- **Data Validation**: Separate validation classes for each operation with comprehensive business rules
- **VisualWorks 8.8 GUI**: Professional interface using VisualWorks GUI framework
- **Persistent Storage**: Database connectivity for reliable data persistence
- **Search Functionality**: Search employees by name, department, and other criteria
- **Windows Executable**: Generates standalone .exe files for Windows deployment
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Model-View-Controller pattern

## System Requirements

- **VisualWorks 8.8** or later
- **Windows 7** or later (Windows 11 recommended)
- **Database** support (SQLite or equivalent)
- **Minimum 512MB RAM**
- **50MB disk space**

## Project Structure

### Core Model Classes
- `Employee.st` - Employee data model with properties and business logic
- `EmployeeDatabase.st` - Database connection and operations management

### Validation Classes
- `CreateEmployeeValidator.st` - Validation rules for employee creation
- `ReadEmployeeValidator.st` - Validation rules for employee retrieval operations
- `UpdateEmployeeValidator.st` - Validation rules for employee updates
- `DeleteEmployeeValidator.st` - Validation rules for employee deletion

### Service Layer
- `EmployeeService.st` - Business logic and CRUD operations coordinator

### GUI Components (VisualWorks)
- `EmployeeManagementWindow.st` - Main application window
- `EmployeeListView.st` - Employee list display component
- `EmployeeFormView.st` - Employee create/edit form
- `EmployeeSearchView.st` - Search functionality interface

### Application Framework
- `EmployeeManagementController.st` - MVC controller coordinating GUI and business logic
- `EmployeeManagementApp.st` - Application entry point and initialization
- `deployment.st` - VisualWorks executable deployment configuration

## Installation & Setup

### For VisualWorks 8.8 Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-Rachapudi/ems-st.git
   cd ems-st
   ```

2. **Open VisualWorks 8.8 IDE**

3. **Load all Smalltalk files**:
   - Load each `.st` file in the following order:
     - Employee.st
     - EmployeeDatabase.st
     - All validator files (Create*, Read*, Update*, Delete*)
     - EmployeeService.st
     - All GUI files (Employee*View.st, EmployeeManagementWindow.st)
     - EmployeeManagementController.st
     - EmployeeManagementApp.st

4. **Compile all classes** in VisualWorks

5. **Initialize the database**:
   ```smalltalk
   EmployeeDatabase instance.
   ```

6. **Start the application**:
   ```smalltalk
   EmployeeManagementApp start.
   ```

## Building Windows Executable

### Using VisualWorks Deployment Manager

1. **Open Deployment Manager** in VisualWorks IDE

2. **Create new deployment configuration**:
   - Application Name: `EmployeeManagementSystem`
   - Main Class: `EmployeeManagementApp`
   - Startup Method: `#main`
   - Target: Windows Executable

3. **Add required classes** (all classes from the project)

4. **Configure deployment settings**:
   - Executable name: `EmployeeManagement.exe`
   - Include VisualWorks runtime: Yes
   - Target platform: Windows
   - Minimum Windows version: Windows 7
   - Preferred: Windows 11

5. **Build executable** - generates standalone `EmployeeManagement.exe`

## Conversion Notes

This project has been converted from ANSI Smalltalk to VisualWorks 8.8 format with the following key changes:

- **Class Definitions**: Updated from ANSI `Object subclass: #ClassName` to VisualWorks `ClassName class` format
- **Method Categories**: Converted from `!ClassName methodsFor: 'category'!` to VisualWorks format
- **GUI Components**: Updated superclasses for VisualWorks compatibility (ApplicationModel, SelectionInList)
- **Database Connectivity**: Adapted database connection syntax for VisualWorks
- **Package Structure**: Organized for VisualWorks package system

## Architecture

### MVC Pattern
- **Model**: Employee, EmployeeDatabase
- **View**: All GUI components (*View.st, *Window.st)
- **Controller**: EmployeeManagementController, EmployeeService

### Service Layer
- **EmployeeService**: Coordinates business logic and validation
- **Validators**: Separate validation logic for each operation
- **Database**: Abstracted data access layer

### GUI Framework
- **VisualWorks-Native**: Uses VisualWorks GUI components
- **Event-Driven**: Proper event handling and user interaction
- **Responsive**: Professional appearance with proper layout management

## Development Notes

### VisualWorks 8.8 Compatibility
- Built for VisualWorks 8.8
- Uses VisualWorks GUI framework
- Compatible with VisualWorks deployment tools
- Follows VisualWorks standards and conventions

### Code Organization
- Each class in separate .st file
- Proper method categorization
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling

## Version History
